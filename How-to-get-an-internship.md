# Getting a CS internship in college

This document is intended to be a descriptive guide to getting computer science internships as a underclass(wo)man at Whitworth, but can be applied to just about anyone, anywhere.
Besides a general route to follow, we have tried to provide explanations and analogies that should give more than an idea of what we mean.
  
Some truths before we begin:
- Even though the title (and the very existence) of this document could insinuate that getting an internship is a prime measure of success, that I have found, is very untrue. I think the prime measures of success are learning and growth. Internship is just one of the many tangible ways to evaluate these arbitrary measures. In short, not getting an internship does not mean you failed. As long as you are learning and growing, both technically and as a person, you are succeeding.

## Frequently asked questions  

#### What is git and github?  
The straightforward definition of git is that it is a version-control tool.
  
#### What languages to learn?
- Markdown - Lightweight markup language used in many tools/apps like github, reddit, slack, flowdock etc. Its widespread use means that you will surely encounter markout at some point in your career. This document itself is written in markdown. Technically, you do not even need to know the [syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as long as you know how to use it, although its fairly simple to remember.
- Javascript
